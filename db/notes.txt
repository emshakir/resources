PERSON TABLE - Owner

NAME
EMAIL
COUNTRY

COUNTRY TABLE - Reference

COUNTRY_CODE
COUNTRY_NAME

When I want to create a mapping between both the tables and use a different column as the foreign key column I have to mention the @JoinColumn
on top the mapping column and need to provide the coumn name from owning table.

@JoinTable(name = "COUNTRY", nullable = false)

note: The column of the reference table should be primary key.

P.S: If we want to have a bidirectional relationship between the two tables i.e., 
I should have possibility to fetch PERSON data using COUNTRY from PERSON Table(all persons belong to this country)
